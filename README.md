# KodeResto Website Project

## Overview

Welcome to the KodeResto Website Project! This activity is designed to utilize your skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap that you've learned in our bootcamp. You'll be working on an existing project for a fictional restaurant, KodeResto, which offers a variety of cuisines and event services.

Your task is to improve and expand the website by focusing on the Cuisines section in the navigation bar.

## Project Files

- `index.html`: The main landing page of the KodeResto website.
- `events.html`: A dedicated page showcasing the events catered by KodeResto.
- `css/style.css`: The stylesheet for custom styles.
- Image files: Located in the `./img/` directory.

## Your Challenge

### Cuisines Section

Currently, the website has a Cuisines dropdown in the navigation bar with different types of cuisines offered by KodeResto. Your challenge is to:

1. **Option 1 (Multiple Pages):** Create separate pages for each cuisine type (KodeResto Specialty, Korean, Filipino, American). Each page should be designed to reflect the specific cuisine's theme and style.

2. **Option 2 (Single Page):** Alternatively, you can opt to create a single, comprehensive Cuisines page. This page should have different sections for each cuisine type, with a unique design and content reflecting the specific characteristics of each cuisine.

### Guidelines

- Ensure that your design is consistent with the existing style of the website.
- Use Bootstrap components where appropriate to enhance the layout and user experience.
- Make sure your pages are responsive and look good on all device sizes.

### Ideas for Enhancement

- Use high-quality images relevant to each cuisine.
- Include descriptions, special dishes, or interesting facts about each cuisine.
- Implement interactive elements, such as image carousels or hover effects, to engage users.

## Submission

After finishing your challenge, please upload your project to your GitHub repository, including all HTML, CSS, and image files. Ensure that your pages are rigorously tested before submission. You can then submit the link of your GitHub repo either through Canvas or the Google Form provided by your instructor.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Adherence to the project guidelines.
- Creativity and quality of design.
- Responsiveness and functionality across different devices.
- Code quality and organization.

Good luck, and we can't wait to see what delicious designs you cook up for KodeResto!
